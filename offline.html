    <p>In the meantime, here are some interesting facts about the International Space Station:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. It is a joint project between five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada).</li>
        <li>It travels at an incredible speed of approximately <strong>28,000 kilometers per hour</strong>. It travels around the planet roughly every 90 minutes, meaning it completes about <strong>15.5 orbits in a day</strong>. This means the crew sees <strong>16 sunrises and sunsets each day!</strong></li>
        <li>The height or altitude of the International Space Station (ISS) varies slightly over time, but it typically orbits Earth at an altitude of approximately <strong>400 kilometers</strong> above the Earth's surface</li>
        <li>It weighs approximately 420,000 kg and measures about 109 meters in length and 73 meters in width</li>
        <li>The ISS was not launched in one piece. It was assembled in space, starting in 1998, with over 40 assembly missions needed to put it together. Various modlies and components were delivered by space shuttles and other spacecraft.</li>
        <li>Astronauts aboard the ISS experience microgravity, giving them the sensation of floating. This allows them to conduct unique experiments that aren't possible on Earth, including studying the effects of long-term space travel on the human body.</li>
        <li>The station's solar arrays span about 240 feet (73 meters) and generate up to 120 kilowatts of electricity.</li>
        <li>The ISS recycles about 93% of the water on board, including urine and sweat, to minimize the need for water resupply missions.</li>
        <li>The ISS is one of the brightest objects in the sky and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. It appears as a bright, fast-moving object across the sky, particularly during dusk or dawn.</li>
        <li>The ISS has hosted 279 individuals from 22 countries as of March 2024.</li>
    </ul>
